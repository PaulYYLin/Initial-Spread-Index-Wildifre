Global Fire Weather Indices - ISI using overwintered DC start-up
Dataset: initial_spread_index_1979-2018.nc

Description:
This dataset was developed by Natural Resources Canada using the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5-HRS Reanalysis product (C3S, 2017) as inputs to the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System R Package (Wang et al. 2017).
ISI index is a numerical rating of the expected rate of firespread. It combines the effects of wind and FFMC on rate of spread without the influence of variable quantities of fuel.
